description: This resource provides information about a  program calculates the velocity
  profile of a shear-thinning polymer fluid in pressure-driven flow between two infinite,
  parallel plates separated by a distance B. The bottom plate is stationary and the
  top plate is moving at a specified velocity in the x-direction. The pressure gradient
  in the x-direction is specified and is used to drive the flow.
